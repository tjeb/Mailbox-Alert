Short-term

Plans for 0.17:
- msg body
- multiple alerts at the same time (per folder? global?)
- initial configuration
- selectable popup style
- text for indefinite duration

? change fonts

-: todo
*: done

Review issues:
5) accesskeys should really be localized as well as names.


Other ideas:
- close any open window if tb gets focus?
- msg preview
- msg body
- msg raw
- msg url?
    (what about storing it in a file, and pointing to that)
- attachments to file
    (same idea, do we have mktemp?)
- allow for quoting in settings
- 'alert on all new messages' option
- tile options for show message
- biff
- use tb's built-in window
- slide for custom position

- Automated tests
- consistent debugging data
- Options for alert popups
    (several 'themes'? fully configurable?)
-- check windows sound issue
    - new sound code in tb3?

- color picker for alert window?

- new icon
- create default ding sound
